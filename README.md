##### Steps to do this challenge:
1) Find and get a list from the document.
2) Create function `sortList`, which takes a `list` property, and sorts list items in descending order by salary from data attribute. (Salary from data attribute is a string, do not forget to convert it to number, write helper function for it). Append sorted items to list.
3) Create function `getEmployees`, which takes a `list` property, and returns an array of right objects.
4) Call both functions.
5) Done.

You don't need to change styles or HTML layout in this task. Change only `main.js` file.
