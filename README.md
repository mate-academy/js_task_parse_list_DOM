### Task: Parse list with data attributes

Hey there! Can you parse data from the list and sort it based on data attributes?

Your task: Sort list by salary in descending order.
Get an array of employees. Write two functions: 
- first, which sorts the list by salary from data attributes
- second, which returns an array of objects, where objects are employees.

The schema for the employee:
```
{
  name, 
  position,
  salary,
  age
}
```

Employees list:

Expected result after soring:

You can read about non-standard attributes and dataset [here](https://javascript.info/dom-attributes-and-properties#non-standard-attributes-dataset)

##### Steps to do this challenge:
1) Find and get a list from the document.
2) Create function `sortList`, which takes a `list` property, and sorts list items in descending order by salary from data attribute. (Salary from data attribute is a string, do not forget to convert it to number, write helper function for it). Append sorted items to list.
3) Create function `getEmployees`, which takes a `list` property, and returns an array of right objects.
4) Call both functions.
5) Done.

You don't need to change styles or HTML layout in this task. Change only `main.js` file.
